# 🚀 My Data Science & Analysis Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! This project serves as a centralized hub for my progress in Data Science, focusing on high-performance computing with NumPy, structured data manipulation with Pandas, and database management with SQL.



## 📂 Project Structure

Below is the list of modules and projects I have completed or am currently working on:

| Project Folder | Tools | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [📂 NumPy Analysis](./NumPy_Analysis/) | NumPy, Pandas | **Mathematical Foundations:** MNIST preprocessing (Normalization, Reshaping, Masking), Matrix Algebra, and Pearson Correlation Analysis on Titanic data. |
| [📂 Pandas Analysis](./Pandas_Analysis/) | Pandas | **End-to-End EDA:** Comprehensive Titanic dataset cleaning, Feature Engineering (Regex/One-Hot Encoding), Relational Merging, and IQR-based Outlier Detection. |
| [📂 SQL Queries](./SQL_Queries/) | SQL, PostgreSQL | (Coming Soon) Database management, Schema Design, and complex query optimization. |

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
- **Python:** The core language used for all data processing scripts.
- **NumPy:** High-performance array computing, Linear Algebra, and image-to-matrix manipulation.
- **Pandas:** Tabular data handling, Statistical Aggregation, and end-to-end data cleaning pipelines.
- **SQL:** Data extraction, joins, and database interaction (In Progress).
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive development environment for documented, reproducible analysis.
