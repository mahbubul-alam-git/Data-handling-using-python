# 🚀 My Data Science & Analysis Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! Here, I am organizing all my projects from my Data Science journey. This repository primarily focuses on NumPy, Pandas, and SQL.

## 📂 Project Structure

Below is the list of various modules and projects I have worked on:

| Project Folder | Tools | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [📂 NumPy Analysis](./NumPy_Analysis/) | NumPy, Pandas | MNIST dataset preprocessing, Image masking, and Matrix operations. |
| [📂 Pandas Analysis](./Pandas_Analysis/) | Pandas | **Titanic Dataset Analysis:** Extensive EDA, handling missing values, feature engineering (One-Hot Encoding, Regex), DataFrame merging, and Outlier detection using IQR. |
| [📂 SQL Queries](./SQL_Queries/) | SQL, PostgreSQL | (Coming Soon) Database management, Joins, and complex query optimization. |

### 📊 Pandas Project Highlights: Titanic Dataset
* **EDA & Filtering:** Extracted statistical summaries and filtered data using complex multi-conditional logic (e.g., specific age groups and passenger classes).
* **Data Cleaning:** Imputed missing values (Age with median, Embarked with mode) and dropped unusable columns to maintain data integrity.
* **Feature Engineering:** Extracted passenger titles using Regex, engineered a new `FamilySize` feature, and applied categorical One-Hot Encoding.
* **Advanced Manipulation:** Demonstrated SQL-like operations by merging DataFrames (`pd.merge`) and performing complex sorting/grouping.
* **Outlier Detection:** Used the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to calculate boundaries and identify statistical anomalies in ticket fares.
